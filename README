A Java implementation of the DNS.com API.

This API requires the SLF4J library in order to perform logging. It also requires the Apache HTTPClient 
library to perform API calls to the ReSTful web service.
 
See the SLF4J web site for information on how to use that library (http://www.slf4j.org/)
See the HTTPClient web site for information on how to use that library (http://hc.apache.org/downloads.cgi)
